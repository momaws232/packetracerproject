# Packet Tracer Project

The **Packet Tracer Project** is designed to simulate network packet transmission, providing functionalities such as delay ping and packet visualization. This tool aids in understanding network behaviors and troubleshooting.

## Features

- **Delay Ping Functionality:** Simulate network latency and measure round-trip time for packets.
- **Packet Visualization:** Visual representation of packet flow within the network.
- **Network Simulation:** Emulate various network scenarios to study packet behavior.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the application.
- `assets/`: Includes any graphical assets or data files used in the project.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `LICENSE`: License information.
